# TechnoHacks_Classify_Iris_Flowers
The Classification of Iris Flowers project involves building a machine-learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal dimensions. This classic project is often used as an introductory example in the field of machine learning and serves as a foundation for understanding various concepts and techniques.

# Objectives:

Data Collection: Obtain the Iris dataset, a well-known and publicly available dataset that contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare and preprocess the dataset, including handling missing values (if any), scaling the features, and encoding the target variable.

Model Building: Build a classification model to predict the species of iris flowers. In this project, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is used, although other classification algorithms could also be explored.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the hyperparameters of the KNN classifier, such as the number of neighbors (k), to improve the model's performance.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. Cross-validation may also be applied to ensure robustness.

Visualization: Create visualizations to gain insights into the dataset and model performance. Common visualizations include scatter plots of feature distributions, box plots, violin plots, and correlation heatmaps.

# Key Steps:

Data loading and exploration to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
Data preprocessing, including handling any missing values and standardizing features.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Building a KNN classifier and tuning its hyperparameters using techniques like grid search.
Training the model on the training data and evaluating it on the test data.
Generating a classification report and confusion matrix to assess the model's performance.
Creating visualizations to visualize feature distributions, relationships, and model results.

# Expected Outcomes:

A trained machine learning model capable of classifying iris flowers into species based on their sepal and petal dimensions.
Evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to quantify the model's performance.
Visualizations that provide insights into the dataset and help explain the model's decision-making process.
A better understanding of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and its application in classification tasks.
